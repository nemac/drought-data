This project contains a copy of NCDC's historical Palmer Drought Severity Index data from
http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cirs/drd964x.pdsi.txt in its original format, and also
in individual files by climate division.  The `extract-divisions` script creates the individual
files from the original `drd964x.pdsi.txt` file.
